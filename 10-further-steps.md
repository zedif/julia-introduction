Julia provides comprehensive documentation as well as examples.

One of the likely best entry points is [Getting Started with Julia](https://julialang.org/learning/), which links to

- the [Julia Academy](https://juliaacademy.com/courses): a list of free online courses
- the [Julia Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/julia): free online exercises
- and last but not least, the [Julia manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/)

The Julia ecosystem already provides over 10,000 additional packages, for all kinds of purposes and from all kinds of research.
There are so many in fact, that it sometimes is best to [search](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages) the database by topic.
